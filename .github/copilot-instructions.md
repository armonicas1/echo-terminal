## Python Coding Standards and Best Practices
- Follow PEP 8 guidelines for style.
- Use descriptive variable and function names.
- Write docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods.
- Organize imports properly: standard library imports first, then third-party imports, followed by local application/library imports.
- Keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- Use list comprehensions and generator expressions where appropriate.
- Write unit tests and use a testing framework like pytest.
- Handle exceptions properly; use try/except blocks.

## PineScript Coding Standards and Best Practices
- Use consistent indentation and spacing.
- Name variables clearly to reflect their purpose.
- Utilize built-in functions effectively to reduce code complexity.
- Comment on complex logic to enhance readability.
- Avoid using global variables unnecessarily.
- Structure code into functions to improve reusability.
- Test scripts thoroughly with different market conditions to ensure robustness.
